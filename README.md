Javier Tom√°s, engineer student, 17 years old, from Mexico.

I'm in my first year of university, interested in pursuing a major in mechatronics engineering. Electronics is an incredibly fascinating field, here I hope to develop several skills and learn the fundamentals well enough to become aquainted with the world of development by integrating both electronics and programming.
I would love to work on small projects to improve the quality of life, as well as on personal passion projects.
